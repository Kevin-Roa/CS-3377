# A shell script to:
#		Play a number guessing game
#		Player must repeatedly guess a number until they get it right
#		Game tells player whether guess was high/low
#		Score output into a highscore file
#		At the end, display top 3 scores from highscores file
#		Extras:
#			Added option to play again
#			Added ability to quit in the middle of playing
#			Added exit message
#			Added input validity checking
#			Utilized functions to increase readability and code reuse
# Usage (In shell):
#   1. ./guessingGame.sh

#!/bin/bash

#	Runs when player guesses the correct number
function onWin {
	#	Displays win prompt and score
	echo "\nYou win!"
	echo "Score: $score"

	saveScore
	displayTopScores
	playAgain
}

#	Save the player's score to a file
function saveScore {
	# Prompt for name
	printf '\nEnter name: '
	read name

	#	Save score + name to highscores file
	echo "$score $name" >> ./highscores
}

# Display the top 3 scores in the highscore file
function displayTopScores {
	echo "\nTop 3 Scores:"
	grep "" ./highscores | sort -n | head -3
	echo ''

# Resets all necessary values to their defaults
# Generates a new random number

#	Displays closing message then exits script
